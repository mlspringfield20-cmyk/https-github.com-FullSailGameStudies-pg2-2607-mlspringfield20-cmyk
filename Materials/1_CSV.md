## 🧾 Overview

**CSV** is a simple, widely-used data format for storing **tabular data** (data structured in rows and columns). Each line in a CSV file corresponds to a **row**, and each value within that line corresponds to a **column**, separated by a **delimiter**, typically a comma (`,`).

CSV is popular because it is:
- **Human-readable**
- **Lightweight**
- **Easily parsed** by programming languages and spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, Python, R)

## 📐 Structure

A typical CSV file has:
1. **Header row** (optional): Names of the columns.
2. **Data rows**: Each row contains values corresponding to the columns.

### Basic Example

```csv
Name,Age,Major
Alice,21,Computer Science
Bob,22,Mathematics
Charlie,20,Physics
```

This represents a table like:

| Name    | Age | Major           |
|---------|-----|------------------|
| Alice   | 21  | Computer Science |
| Bob     | 22  | Mathematics      |
| Charlie | 20  | Physics          |

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. **Delimiters**
While commas are standard, other delimiters like semicolons (`;`) or tabs (`\t`) may be used, especially in regions where commas are used as decimal points.

### 2. **Quoting**
Fields containing commas, newlines, or quotes must be enclosed in **double quotes** (`"`). Quotes inside fields are escaped by doubling them.

```csv
Name,Comment
Alice,"Loves ""data"", math, and science"
```

### 3. **Missing Values**
Empty fields represent missing data.

```csv
Name,Age,Major
Alice,21,
Bob,,Mathematics
```

## 🛠️ Use Cases

- **Data exchange** between systems (e.g., exporting from a database to Excel)
- **Data ingestion** in data science and machine learning workflows
- **Configuration files** for simple applications

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No support for nested or hierarchical data
- No data types (everything is a string)
- Ambiguity in delimiters and quoting rules across implementations
