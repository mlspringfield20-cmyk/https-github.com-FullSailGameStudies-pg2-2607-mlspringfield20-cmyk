In C++, both `struct` and `class` are used to define **user-defined types** that can hold **data** and **functions**. While they are **very similar**, there are a few key differences that are important to understand.

---

## 🔹 What is a `struct`?

A `struct` (short for **structure**) is a way to group related variables (and optionally functions) under one name.

```cpp
struct Point {
    double x;
    double y;

    void print() {
        std::cout << "(" << x << ", " << y << ")" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

### ✅ Characteristics of `struct`:
- **Default access modifier**: `public` 🔓
- Typically used for **plain-old-data (POD)** types.
- Supports **member functions**, **constructors**, **destructors**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** (just like classes).
- Often used in **C-style programming** or for **simple data containers**.

## 🔸 What is a `class`?

A `class` is a more formal and flexible way to define objects in C++. It encapsulates **data** and **behavior** and is the foundation of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in C++.

```cpp
class Circle {
private:
    double radius;

public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    double area() const {
        return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }
};
```

### ✅ Characteristics of `class`:
- **Default access modifier**: `private` 🔒
- Designed for **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.
- Encourages **data hiding** and **modular design**.
- Ideal for **complex systems** and **OOP design patterns**.

## ⚖️ Key Differences

| Feature                  | `struct` 🧱                | `class` 🏛️                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Default access modifier  | `public` 🔓                | `private` 🔒               |
| Inheritance default      | `public`                  | `private`                 |
| Use case                 | Simple data containers     | Full OOP design            |
| Syntax                   | `struct Name { ... };`     | `class Name { ... };`      |
| Functionality            | Same as class              | Same as struct             |

## 🧠 When to Use What?

- Use **`struct`** when:
  - You need a **simple data structure**.
  - You want **public access** by default.
  - You're working with **interfacing C code**.

- Use **`class`** when:
  - You need **encapsulation** and **data hiding**.
  - You're building **complex systems**.
  - You want to leverage **OOP principles**.

## 🧪 Fun Fact

In C++, the only **technical difference** between `struct` and `class` is the **default access level**. Everything else—constructors, destructors, inheritance, etc.—works the same!
